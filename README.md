# Genomic Chord Dependency Diagram

### What Has Been Done So Far? The protype design:
This visualization consists of a genomic chord dependency diagram that showcases the relationships between different genomic features or metagenomic phylogenies. Using D3.js, I made an interactive diagram where each group (or arc) represents a microorganism, and the connecting chords illustrate their relationships or dependencies. The visualization directly highlights relationships between species via the hover feature when the cursor is over a specific group, emphasizing the connections while dimming unrelated ones. The project includes a clean layout, color-coded arcs for better readability, and a toolchain that seamlessly combines D3.js functionality with modern data structures for ingesting large metagenomic datasets.

Additionally, the project was structured to include reusable components such as the `app.js` file for logic, `style.css` for styling, and `index.html` as the container. The visualization not only works smoothly across browsers but is also scalable to include additional genomic data (which will increase in size and requires a level of accomadation). By leveraging open-source tools like D3.js, the visualization is lightweight and can be extended/adjusted with minimal effort.

### Project Challenges and Design Rationale?
The most challenging part of this project is ensuring the scalability and interpretability of the visualization when working with large, real-world genomic/metagenomic datasets. As the data size increases, so do the number of arcs and chords, which can lead to visual clutter and overlapping elements, making the diagram difficult to read. Addressing this challenge requires implementing techniques like filtering, zooming, or aggregating data to maintain clarity without losing valuable information. This is especially useful for long read genomic data files like nanopore sequencing or metagenomic sequence datas from the environment where species "hits" can be diverse and contain large phylogenetic spread. 

Another major challenge lies in defining meaningful relationships between microorganisms or genomic features. Real-world genomic data is complex, often requiring advanced preprocessing to ensure that the relationships depicted in the diagram are scientifically accurate and contextually meaningful. Additionally, ensuring that the interactive features (for example: hover effects, tooltips, etc.) remain responsive and informative as the dataset grows in complexity. Finally, designing for cross-browser compatibility and optimizing performance for large datasets will require significant effort to ensure that the visualization remains accessible and smooth for all users.
